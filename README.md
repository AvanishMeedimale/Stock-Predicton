# Stock-Predicton
A mini project to create a model using the Ornstein-Uhlenbeck process as a basis. The model takes a sample stock and uses Maximum Likelihood Esstimation to optimize the parameters defined by this process. The stochastic model then predicts future stock price movements, as defined by the differential equation.
