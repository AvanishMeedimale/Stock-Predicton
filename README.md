# Stock-Predicton
Using the Ornstein-Uhlenbeck process as a basis, the model takes a sample stock and uses Maximum Likelihood Esstimation to optimize the parameters defined by this process. The same stochastic model then predicts future stock price movements, though this model does change every generation due to the unpredictability of the Weiner process component in the Ornstein-Uhlenbeck process.

Plans to incorporate machine learning to the model to prevent problems of overfitting.
